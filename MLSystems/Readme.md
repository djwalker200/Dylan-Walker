## Overview

This is a collection of code samples from my work in the course "Principles of Large-Scale Machine Learning Systems" at Cornell University during the Fall 2022 semester.

## Samples

bayesian_optimization.py - python implementation of a gaussian process for solving a low-dimensional derivative-free optimization problem.

hyperparameter_search.py - Implementation and analysis on a variety of hyperparameter search methods

multithreaded_SGD.py - Experiments with multiple approaches to optimize computational efficiency including parallel programming (explicit and implicit) as well as low-precision arithmetic.

optimization_methods.py - Experiments comparing the performance of multiple popular gradient-based optimization methods
