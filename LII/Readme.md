## Overview

This directory contains code samples for my masters project with the Cornell Legal Information Institute (LII). In this project we deployed a system to enrich legal documents by establishing XML references between instances of defined terms and their corresponding definitions in the US State Regulations. This project aims to increase the accessibility and readability of legal publications in an effort to empower individuals without a legal background.

## Samples 

xml_helpers.py - Contains helper functions for parsing/editing XML files

definitions.py - Contains customized data structures for representing definition and defined term objects

explore_scoping.py - Main script code with multiple functionalities. The primary usage is to match all defined terms to corresponding definitions within a given state corpus using a scope-matching algorithm.

Final Report.pdf - Technical write-up summarizing the methods and implementation of our work. This was submitted to Cornell University as part of my masters degree.

FinalPresentation.pdf - Slideshow presentation outlining the entire project. This was presented to members of the LII and Cornell Law School during my masters degree.
