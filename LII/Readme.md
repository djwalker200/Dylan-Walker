This directory contains code samples for my masters project with the Cornell Legal Information Institute (LII). In this project we deployed a system to enrich legal documents by establishing XML references between instances of defined terms and their corresponding definitions in the US State Regulations. This project aims to increase the accessibility and readability of legal publications in an effort to empower individuals without a legal background.
