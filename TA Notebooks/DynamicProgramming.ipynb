        "\n",
        "The Longest Common Subsequence problem is to find the longest common subsequence between two sequences where the elements are not required to appear consecutively in the original sequences. For our purposes the sequences we will be considering will be strings of characters. As a first example lets consider the following two strings of letters:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\\begin{align*} &ABCD \\\\ &ACDB \\end{align*}$$\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "A naive way to solve this simple example is by writing out all of the possible subsequences and comparing.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example we can see the longest common subsequence is $ACD$ with length 3. However, this is a small example with only a few characters in each string. What if we have strings of length 100, or 1000? The number of subsequences for a sequence of length $n$ is $O(2^n)$, meaning this approach cannot scale well. How can we use dynamic programming to efficiently solve this problem?\n"

        "We will use a dynamic programming solution similar to the Manhattan Tourist problem in class to solve this problem.
