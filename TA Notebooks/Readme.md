## Overview

This folder contains a collection of python notebooks I developed as a TA for the course "Computational Genetics and Genomics" at Cornell University during the Fall 2022 semester. These notebooks were presented as lectures aimed to reinforce the students' understanding of course topics.

## Samples

Deep Learning - Folder containing a notebook and supporting images. This was a demo I designed to introduce students to the concept of deep learning and neural networks.

DynamicProgramming.ipynb - Demo I designed to introduce students to dynamic problem and work through a hands-on example finding longest common subsequences.

GibbsSampling.ipynb - Demo to teach students about Gibbs Sampling methods with a hands-on implementation walk through for a model problem.

MonteCarlo.ipynb - Demo for Monte Carlo simulations with some unique examples and use cases that I designed to present to the class.
